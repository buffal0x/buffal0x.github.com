                                    internet everything is monitored. Some people have a problem with this and others
                                    don't. You often hear "if I don't have anything to hide then what is the problem?".
                                    Well my answer to that is you SHOULD be able to choose wether you are monitored or not.

                                                    <p>Tor, short for The Onion Router, is free and open-source software
                                                        for enabling anonymous communication. It directs
                                                        Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay
                                                        network, consisting of more than six thousand relays,
                                                        to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone performing
                                                        network surveillance or traffic analysis. Using Tor
                                                        makes it more difficult to trace a user's Internet activity.
                                                        Tor's intended use is to protect the personal privacy of
                                                        its users, as well as their freedom and ability to communicate
                                                        confidentially through IP address anonymity using Tor
                                                        exit nodes.</p>

                                                    <p>First off you need to know what type of OS (operation system) you
                                                        got. Could be for example Windows, Mac, Linux or android. Tor is
                                                        available on all OS's even smartphones. Though I would never
                                                        recommend running Tor on a phone since Tor originally was made
                                                        for computers and if you run Tor on a mobile device you're
                                                        running a greater risk of DNS leakage which essentially means
                                                        that your ISP(Internet Service Provider) could possibly see your
                                                        encrypted network traffic which could put you at a great risk of
                                                        getting exposed. If you must I'd prefer android since Android
                                                        got the offical made Tor Browser. iOS devices doesn't have an
                                                        offically made Tor Browser and that could be a <a
                                                            href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/honeypots-in-cybersecurity-explained/"
                                                            target="_blank">Honeypot</a> just by itself. Depending on
                                                        what you are doing while using Tor getting exposed could be
                                                        devastating to you.<br> It's very much like the web browser you
                                                        are already using except that everything you do all network
                                                        traffic goes through
                                                        the Tor network. That itself might be hard to wrap your head
                                                        around but I feel it is important that you at least have a
                                                        hum on how it works. <br><br>

                                                        To minimize the risk of DNS leakage you could run a VPN
                                                        alongside with Tor. But you must be careful with what type of
                                                        VPN you are running because if the company collects your network
                                                        logs they could depending on which country you live be forced to
                                                        show law enforcement your internet traffic. <br><br>
                                                        So now when we have that out of our way let's get into how to
                                                        actually install Tor. In this example we are going to install
                                                        the Tor Browser. Start off with opening your usual normal web
                                                        browser and either search for Tor Browser or just click here: <a
                                                            href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">torproject.org</a>
                                                        and choose the version as we meantioned before according to
                                                        which OS you have installed. Follow the setup wizard and now you
                                                        should have the Tor Browser installed.

                                                    <p>
                                                        From now on every website you visit through the browser is first going through the Tor network before reaching the website. But now you can access so called "onion" websites which instead of having .com or .org Tor uses ".onion" and can ONLY be accessed through some type of Tor connection. <br><br>
