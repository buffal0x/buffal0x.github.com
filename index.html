                                <p>Tor, short for The Onion Router, is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication. It directs
                                Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network, consisting of more than six thousand relays,
                                to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone performing network surveillance or traffic analysis. Using Tor
                                makes it more difficult to trace a user's Internet activity. Tor's intended use is to protect the personal privacy of
                                its users, as well as their freedom and ability to communicate confidentially through IP address anonymity using Tor
                                exit nodes.</p>

                                <h3 class="s1">How to install Tor</h3>
                                <p>First off you need to know what type of OS (operation system) you got. Could be for example Windows, Mac, Linux or android. Tor is available on all OS's even smartphones. Though I would never recommend running Tor on a phone since Tor originally was made for computers and if you run Tor on a mobile device you're running a greater risk of DNS leakage which essentially means that your ISP(Internet Service Provider) could possibly see your encrypted network traffic which could put you at a great risk of getting exposed. If you must I'd prefer android since Android got the offical made Tor Browser. iOS devices doesn't have an offically made Tor Browser and that could be a <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/honeypots-in-cybersecurity-explained/" target="_blank">Honeypot</a> just by itself. Depending on what you are doing while using Tor getting exposed could be devastating to you.<br> It's very much like the web browser you are already using except that everything you do all network traffic goes through
                                the Tor network. That itself might be hard to wrap your head around but I feel it is important that you at least have a
                                hum on how it works. <br><br>
                                    
                                    To minimize the risk of DNS leakage you could run a VPN alongside with Tor. But you must be careful with what type of VPN you are running because if the company collects your network logs they could depending on which country you live be forced to show law enforcement your internet traffic. <br><br>
                                So now when we have that out of our way let's get into how to actually install Tor. In this example we are going to install the Tor Browser.
