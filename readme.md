## About the project

> A simple AutoHotKey script intended to make programming and coding overall easier by adding shortcut keybinds.
An example could be to add i.e curly brackets but with only the push of 1 button. Or a combo of keys to perform one task. 

> By keybinding to whatever key you may want to use, you can save effort and press 1 button to do things you couldn't do without two arms.

> In my case I have keybinded curly brackets to "Ctrl + Left Alt" instead of taking my hand off my mouse to then press Alt Gr.
